The 1994 Arab Junior Athletics Championships
 was the sixth edition of the international 
 athletics competition for under-20 athletes 
 from Arab countries. It took place in Tunis, 
 Tunisia. Qatar, after a good performance in 
 1992, did not send a team to the competition. 
 A total of 42 athletics events were contested, 
 23 for men and 19 for women.[1]
The women's 10,000 metres was restored to the 
programme after a break in 1992. A women's triple 
jump was contested for the first time. The men's 20 
km road race made its third and final appearance at 
the championships, as junior road events were largely 
ropped from international competition. The men's 
hurdles finals were only recorded to the tenth of a
second due to technical limitations. Wind affected 
parts of the competition, particularly the 200 metres 
races and the horizontal jumps.[1]
In line with increased participation, the standard of 
performers at this event improved. Hadi Soua'an Al-Somaily 
won a men's hurdles double for Saudi Arabia and won multiple 
Asian titles as a senior.[2] Ali Hakimi defended his 1500 
metres title and added the 800 metres crown; he was an 

Olympic finalist two years later.[3] Younes Moudrik took 
the men's long jump title – an event he would win twice at 
the African Championships in Athletics.[4] Seventeen-year-old 
Abderrahmane Hammad was runner-up in the high jump but later 
became the first Arab to win a medal in the high jump at the 
Olympics.[5]
On the women's side, Fatma Lanouar won the 800 metres in 
Tunis and was a two-time Mediterranean Games champion as 
a senior.[6] The runner-up in that event, 16-year-old Hasna 
Benhassi of Morocco, had even greater success in her career, 
which included two Olympic and two World Championships medals.[7] 
Future African champion Aida Sellam of Tunisia won the javelin throw 
and a shot put bronze medal on home turf. The winner of the women's 
walk, Nagwa Ibrahim Ali, would become a prominent athlete in her 
discipline regionally, with three African titles to her name.[1][4]
