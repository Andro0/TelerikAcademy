001  The 1994 Arab Junior Athletics Championships
002   was the sixth edition of the international 
003   athletics competition for under-20 athletes 
004   from Arab countries. It took place in Tunis, 
005   Tunisia. Qatar, after a good performance in 
006   1992, did not send a team to the competition. 
007   A total of 42 athletics events were contested, 
008   23 for men and 19 for women.[1]
009  The women's 10,000 metres was restored to the 
010  programme after a break in 1992. A women's triple 
011  jump was contested for the first time. The men's 20 
012  km road race made its third and final appearance at 
013  the championships, as junior road events were largely 
014  ropped from international competition. The men's 
015  hurdles finals were only recorded to the tenth of a
016  second due to technical limitations. Wind affected 
017  parts of the competition, particularly the 200 metres 
018  races and the horizontal jumps.[1]
019  In line with increased participation, the standard of 
020  performers at this event improved. Hadi Soua'an Al-Somaily 
021  won a men's hurdles double for Saudi Arabia and won multiple 
022  Asian titles as a senior.[2] Ali Hakimi defended his 1500 
023  metres title and added the 800 metres crown; he was an 
024  
025  Olympic finalist two years later.[3] Younes Moudrik took 
026  the men's long jump title ï¿½ an event he would win twice at 
027  the African Championships in Athletics.[4] Seventeen-year-old 
028  Abderrahmane Hammad was runner-up in the high jump but later 
029  became the first Arab to win a medal in the high jump at the 
030  Olympics.[5]
031  On the women's side, Fatma Lanouar won the 800 metres in 
032  Tunis and was a two-time Mediterranean Games champion as 
033  a senior.[6] The runner-up in that event, 16-year-old Hasna 
034  Benhassi of Morocco, had even greater success in her career, 
035  which included two Olympic and two World Championships medals.[7] 
036  Future African champion Aida Sellam of Tunisia won the javelin throw 
037  and a shot put bronze medal on home turf. The winner of the women's 
038  walk, Nagwa Ibrahim Ali, would become a prominent athlete in her 
039  discipline regionally, with three African titles to her name.[1][4]
